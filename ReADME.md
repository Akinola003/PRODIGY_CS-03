Explanation of the Tool:
Length: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
Uppercase letters: The password must contain at least one uppercase letter.
Lowercase letters: The password must contain at least one lowercase letter.
Numbers: The password must include at least one numeric digit.
Special characters: The password must include at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, etc.).
The function evaluates these criteria and assigns a score based on how many conditions the password satisfies. It then gives feedback to help users improve their password strength if needed.

The use of the import re module:
The line import re in Python imports the Regular Expression (regex) module, which provides functions for matching patterns in strings.

In the context of the password strength tool, the re module is used to:

re.search(pattern, string): This function checks if a string contains a substring that matches a specified pattern. For example:
re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) checks if the password contains at least one uppercase letter.
re.search(r'[a-z]', password) checks for at least one lowercase letter.
re.search(r'\d', password) checks for at least one digit.
re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password) checks for at least one special character.
Regular Expressions in this code:
r'[A-Z]': A pattern that matches any uppercase letter.
r'[a-z]': A pattern that matches any lowercase letter.
r'\d': A pattern that matches any digit (0-9).
r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]': A pattern that matches any of the specified special characters.
By importing re, the tool can search for these patterns in the user's password to evaluate its strength.
